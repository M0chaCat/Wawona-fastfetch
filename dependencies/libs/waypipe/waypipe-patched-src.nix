# Produces a pre-patched waypipe source tree for use as a Cargo path dependency.
#
# This is a PURE SOURCE derivation — no compilation. It takes the raw waypipe
# source and applies the iOS/Android/macOS compatibility patches, producing a
# ready-to-compile source tree. By making this a separate derivation, the Nix
# hash only changes when the patch script or raw waypipe source changes.
# Changing wawona source does NOT invalidate this derivation.
#
# Usage:
#   waypipePatchedSrc = pkgs.callPackage ./waypipe-patched-src.nix {
#     inherit waypipe-src;
#     patchScript = ./patch-waypipe-source.sh;
#     platform = "ios";  # or "macos" or "android"
#   };
#
